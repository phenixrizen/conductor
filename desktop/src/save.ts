 * SettingsSaver applies a save from the Settings page and keeps what became of

 * the window follows it, on the same page, as soon as the server runs: the
 * page that saved is gone before its save resolves, and the page that followed
 * asks (#214). The outcome is handed out only once the restart has completed
 * (the supervisor resolves the restart in the turn it reports the server
 * running, long before the page that follows has loaded), so an ask that comes
 * while a restart is pending, the outgoing page's own, gets nothing and takes
 * nothing from the page that follows; a restart that fails leaves nothing to
 * take, and the failure reaches the page that saved, which is still there. A
 * save that changes nothing the server reads, the retry after a failed restart
 * among them (the settings were kept), says saved, never restarted. The IPC
 * hands the outcome to the workbench at the server's current origin only
 * (trusted), which after a port change is the page that followed.
