/**
 * A working-directory field completed from the server: as the text changes,
 * GET /api/paths lists the child directories of the longest existing
 * directory in it (under the allowed roots), each marked when it is a git
 * repository with a commit. Nuxt UI's UInputMenu in autocomplete mode is the
 * combobox: the text is the model and stays editable, the server's entries
 * are its items (its own filter is off: the server filters by what is
 * typed), the arrow keys move, Enter or a click picks (the entry's path
 * replaces the text and the list opens again on its children), Esc closes.
 * The list highlights its first entry after every keystroke, so Enter picks
 * only once the highlight was moved since the text last changed (the arrows,
 * or the pointer over an entry): Enter on a complete path keeps it, and the
 * list stays as it is. With the list closed, Enter belongs to the form
 * around. Until the listing of what is typed arrives, only the entries under
 * it stay, so Enter never puts an entry the text has moved past in its place.
 * Tab moves on and closes the list. The model is the text, whatever is
 * picked.
