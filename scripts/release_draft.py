"""The one draft release a version's packages go into (release.yml, #372, #375).

electron-builder, publishing, uploads to the tag's draft release and makes
one when it finds none, and it looks at the first page of releases only. Two
package jobs that found none at the same moment each made a draft, and the
packages were split over two (#372). So electron-builder only builds; the
release is made once, before the package jobs start, each job uploads its
packages to it by its id, and the end of the workflow checks that the tag has
that one draft with every package on it.

The tag does not exist until the release is published (#375): the updater
reads the repository's releases.atom, which lists a pushed tag even while its
release is a draft, and an app whose channel's newest entry is a draft finds
no latest.yml there and no update at all. So the draft names a tag that does
not exist yet and the commit built (target_commitish); GitHub makes the tag
at that commit when the draft is published.

    python3 scripts/release_draft.py ensure v0.7.0-rc.18 --target <sha>
    python3 scripts/release_draft.py upload v0.7.0-rc.18 desktop/release --target <sha>
    python3 scripts/release_draft.py check v0.7.0-rc.18 packages/ --target <sha>

`ensure` makes the tag's draft as electron-builder would (named the version,
a draft, not a prerelease) at the commit, or keeps the one a run before this
made for the same commit; it refuses a tag that exists, a release that is
published, more than one, or a draft for another commit or under another
spelling of the tag. `upload` puts a build's packages (installers, their
blockmaps, the latest*.yml the updater reads) on that draft, replacing one a
failed run left, after the same refusals; it never makes a release. `check`
refuses the same, a package in the directory (the package jobs' artifacts)
the draft does not have, an installer without its blockmap, and a draft
without the updater's three latest*.yml.

A package's file name is its name on the release: the Windows installer is
named without spaces (electron-builder.yml), as electron-builder would have
published it.

Reads and writes the repository in GITHUB_REPOSITORY through `gh api`
(GH_TOKEN); only Python's standard library otherwise.
